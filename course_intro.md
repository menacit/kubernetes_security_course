More specifically, basic understanding of 
OS-level virtualisation on Linux,
container software like Docker
and how Kubernetes is used.  

A good start would be Menacit's
[introductory virtualisation course](https://%RESOURCES_DOMAIN%/virt) and
[the "Kubernetes introduction" presentation](https://%RESOURCES_DOMAIN%/k8s_intro).

<!--
- We'll cover lots of things in a short amount of time

- In order to be able to do this we'll use scientifically proven methods to Make It Stick

- Basically what the slide says

- Don't forget to have fun!

These resources should be seen as a complement to an instructor lead course, not a replacement.

<!--
- There are several resources to help you learn

- Speaker notes in slides are heavily recommended for recaps/deep diving

- May also be available through LMS, depending on how the course is consumed

- The course is designed to be instructor lead, won't make the most of it on your own, see as aid

- Presentations may be recorded, but only the speaker side for good and bad
